# Git vs. Github
**Git** and **GitHub** are not the same thing. **Git** is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system. **GitHub** is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with **git**. You do not need **GitHub** to use **git**, but you cannot use **GitHub** without using **git**. There are many other alternatives to **GitHub**, such as [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product), and ```host-your-own``` solutions such as [gogs](https://gogs.io/) and [gittea](https://gitea.io/). All of these are referred to in git-speak as ```remotes```, and all are completely optional. You do not need to use a remote to use **git**, but it will make sharing your code with others easier.

Once you are comfortable with **Git** (or even now before you dive into the contents), create a **GitHub account** [here](https://github.com/), it's free and easy. However, if you want to know how to work with **GitHub**, you should first learn Basics of **Git**.
